Goal: to make virtual enviroment for one or more simulated bugs to train their neurons and thereby imitate real life neuron structure

Elements:
    Basic mechanics of creature:
        * importing a mesh
        * rigging the mesh with bones
        * making physics collisions with this mesh
        * making coordinate transformations of this mesh when rotating these bones
        * give the creature input of the enviroment
        * add cost elements like energy consumption
    Network elements:
        * make a representation of a physical network
        * make limitations on how this network can grow
        * add cost elements like energy consumption per neuron or per length of neuron
    Training algorithm of enviroment:
        * ?
    Making a physically realistic enviroment:
        * ?
